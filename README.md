# TVPDC - Time-varying PDC

This is my first public repository with the codes (in Matlab) that I developed during my master of science at University of SÃ£o Paulo. The project lasted approximately 18 months and the results lead, until now, to two publications in international conferences (IEEE EMBC 2015 and 2016).

The main topic of research was on the estimation of  time-varying neural connectivity from multichannel recordings, such as in EEG and MEG.  

Although there are several ways for studying neural connectivity, the one I used here was based on the concept of Granger causality between time series. More specifically, I used the notion of Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) between two time series.
