# Basic examples

Here we have four examples which are basically reproductions from papers in the literature of the PDC. Each example was carefully chosen so that it would show important concepts which were the basis for my M.S. research. Below I give the references for each example and explain the motivation for choosing it. Note that inside each folder you have another README file with more details on the results and considerations about estimations and plotting.

### Example 1 - Baccala2001

Here I simply reproduced some of the figures in the first article where the Partial Directed Coherence was formally presented to the scientific community. All examples were done on toy models and reflect some interesting properties of the PDC.

      Baccalá, Luiz A. and Sameshima, K. "Partial directed coherence: a new concept in neural structure determination" (2001)

### Example 2 - Baccala2008

This is a rather short article where Baccalá and Sameshima show an annoying feature of the PDC: it is not invariant to scale. With this in mind, they use an example where PDC's values lead to wrong causality conclusions. Then, they propose a normalized version for this estimator, which they call the Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). The previous example is used once again and this time the gPDC gives the correct results.

### Example 3 - Astolfi2008

This article

### Example 4 - SunspotData

In this example, I use data from time series which have nothing to do with neural signals
